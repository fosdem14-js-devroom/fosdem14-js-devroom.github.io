{"name":"FOSDEM 2014 JavaScript Developer Room","tagline":"Call for Participation","body":"## FOSDEM 2014 JavaScript Developer Room\r\nGiven JavaScript's maturisation not only in the browser but also server side (thanks to [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)) and even using the language to control flying machines, the time has come to unite the different JavaScript worlds.\r\n\r\nOn 2 February 2014, [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/), the largest free and open source unconference of Europe, will host a JavaScript developer room allowing us to work on open source projects, give talks of interest to our community, ...\r\n\r\nThe setting is [Brussels, Belgium](http://goo.gl/maps/I4u6N). Brussels comes with some fine attributes, one of them being it's pretty much centrally located, an hour away from more famous cities like Amsterdam, Paris and London. It's the capital of a country renowned for beer, french fries, chocolate and rain. \r\n\r\n### Call for Participation\r\nWe issue a call for participation to the JavaScript community. The proposals should be submitted before 1 Dec 2013 using a FOSDEM tool called [Pentabarf](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM14) (we think \"don't ask\", narf).\r\n\r\nPeople that want to submit a proposal have to:\r\n\r\n1. Surf to https://penta.fosdem.org/submission\r\n2. Create an account\r\n3. Enter their proposal (don't forget to select the Javascript devroom track!)\r\n\r\nWe will announce the selected proposals around mid December 2013.\r\n\r\n### Who are we\r\nFor the time being, we are one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. [Steven Beeckman](http://twitter.com/stevenbeeckman): Founder of [Node.js User Group Belgium](http://www.meetup.com/Belgian-node-js-User-Group/). And some other things, mostly not related to JavaScript.\r\n\r\n2. [Laurent Eschenauer](http://twitter.com/eschnou): Created some open source node.js libraries like [webflight](http://eschnou.github.io/ardrone-webflight/).\r\n\r\n3. [Andrew Nesbitt](http://twitter.com/teabass): Andrew is the organiser of the London Node.js User Group and the Great British Node Conference.
